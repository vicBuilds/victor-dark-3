# Victor Dark (https://victor-dark.netlify.app/)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing and interactive manner. 

Using cutting-edge web technologies, I have built this portfolio to provide you with an immersive and engaging experience. The website is powered by React, a popular JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility. React DOM efficiently renders the website's components into the HTML structure, ensuring optimal performance.

To add a touch of creativity and interactivity, I have incorporated React Three Fiber, which enables the inclusion of stunning 3D graphics and animations. React Simple Maps allows for the integration of interactive maps, providing insights into my global experiences and locations.

The user interface of the portfolio website is beautifully crafted using Styled Components, ensuring a visually pleasing and responsive design across different devices.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and learn more about my skills, projects, and experiences. If you have any inquiries or would like to get in touch, please use the contact form powered by EmailJS.

Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio website. I hope you enjoy your experience and gain valuable insights into my work.
